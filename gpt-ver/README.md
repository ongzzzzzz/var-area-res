# Variable-Area Resistor Lab

Interactive p5.js sketch that simulates probing the voltage V(x) along a resistor whose cross-sectional area A(x) is hidden.

- Drive the bar with a configurable current source.
- Move a probe along x to read a noisy voltmeter.
- Log data points or auto-scan to build V(x).
- Reveal the ground-truth A(x) / ideal V(x) for self-check.
